# ðŸš— Vehicle Emission Prediction API

![Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300?text=Vehicle+Emission+Prediction+with+FastAPI+%26+ML)

This project is a machine learning-powered web service built using **FastAPI** that predicts the **CO2 emissions (g/km)** of a vehicle based on its specifications.

It demonstrates the full pipeline from **training an ML model** to **serving it through a web API**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

We use a dataset containing vehicle information like:

- Engine size
- Number of cylinders
- Fuel consumption
- CO2 emissions

Our goal is to build and expose a **machine learning model** that predicts CO2 emissions using these features.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the API

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aliowx/data-analysis.git
cd data-analysis
